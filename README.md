# PHP Playground

This repository is a collection of small and simple PHP projects, experiments, and code snippets.  
The purpose of this repo is to test PHP features, try out new ideas, and learn by building small projects.  

Each project is self-contained in its own folder with a brief description of what it does.  
Feel free to explore, run the code, and experiment with your own PHP ideas.
